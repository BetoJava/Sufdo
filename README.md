# Sufdo (Pygame isometric game)

![Screeshot Sufdo](screenshot/spellPreview.png)

## Description :
This game is largely inspired by Dofus from Ankama games. This was my first big project in 2021, using Pygame, and took me over 300 hours of work.
There are a lot of things to change in the code, as it was an experience that taught me a lot.

Most of the images are owned by Ankama games.
